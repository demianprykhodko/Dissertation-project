# **Launching Backend with Node.js and Frontend with Angular**

### This README provides instructions on how to launch the backend with Node.js and frontend with Angular. Please follow the steps below:

Backend:

To launch the backend with Node.js, you will need to have Node.js installed on your local machine. You can download the latest version of Node.js from the official website. On my own machine I had a v18.13.0 which is an LTS version.

1. Navigate to the "backend" directory in your terminal.
2. Install the required dependencies by running "npm install" or "npm i".
3. No need to create any extra config files
4. Launch the server by running "npm start".

Frontend:

To launch the frontend with Angular, you will need to have Angular CLI installed. You can install Angular CLI using the Node.js package manager (npm) by running the following command in your terminal:

```term
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

This will install the latest version of Angular CLI globally on your machine, allowing you to use the "ng" command in your terminal to generate components, services, and more for your Angular project.

1. Navigate to the "frontend" directory in your terminal.
3. Install the required dependencies by running "npm install".
4. Launch the Angular development server by running "ng serve".

Once the server and frontend are launched, navigate to "http://localhost:4200/" in your browser to access the application.

The backend is running on http://localhost:5002/

Note: It is important to have the backend and frontend running simultaneously for the application to function properly.
